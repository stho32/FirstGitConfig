# FirstGitConfig
A little Powershell-Tool to init the git config

## Purpose

Recently I create virtual machines a lot. Being a developer I always need to install git.
While the installation of git is automated I always have problems remembering the exact lines how to configure the user credentials in git.

To simplify this process - and to evaluate SAPIEN Powershell Studio - I wanted to create a simple UI to help me configure git if it needs to be.
